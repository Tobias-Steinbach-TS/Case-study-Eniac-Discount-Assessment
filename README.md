# Case-study-Eniac-Discount-Assessment
Group work as part of a Data-Analytics Bootcamp | Exploration of a dataset and presentation

## Summary
We explored a new corrupted dataset. Progressed from exploring to cleaning our data and analyzed it in the context of discount effectivity for our fictitious company. Deliverable was a business presentation showing findings backed by our plots and recommendations on discount strategy and improved data collection.

## Tools
For data exploration and analysis we used Python and were introduced to its module Seaborn to generate our plots. We chose Figma to create our presentation.

## Key Learnings
Learned set of commands to get a feeling of the size of our dataset, the quality (especially the presence of missing values). We assessed whether we drop columns or rows or populate them with values (as so often: it depends!). Worked a lot with grouping and aggregating to retrieve answers to the business questions posed on our learning platform and later by ourselves. Enjoyed the flexibility of Seaborn (and the clean plot-display in VS Code). Also Figma was a great choice for our presentation, the free templates and community-created add-ons permit for beautiful presentation options.

## Challenges Overcame
It sometimes can be easy to get lost in exploration and it's good to remind yourself often what exactly you were trying to find out. Also constant commenting makes life easier when working with multiple Googlew Colab notebooks at the same time. Ensuring that the group moves in the same direction is not always easy, especially when not all members are fans of group work and you only collaborate remotely. Compromising and a time schedule have been our approach that led to success.

## Additional reflections
Enjoyed to tried to fill gaps that opened up. Used my business background to steer our analysis towards relevant fields.
